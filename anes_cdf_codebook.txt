           For non-panel cases this corresponds to 4-digit year of study followed
           by 4-digit case id from the study as found in VCF0006.
           For panel cases, this corresponds to 4-digit year of first year of
           time-series participation followed by 4-digit case id from first
           participation study .  For example, 1958 ANES panel cases (first
           interviewed in the 1956 anes) are numbered 1956xxxx where xxxx
           corresponds to the case ID the respondent had been assigned previously
           in the 1956 study; VCF0006, by contrast, includes the respondent's 1958
           ANES case ID.
           Studies including panel cases as part of the overall study cross-section
           are flagged in VCF00016.
           1958 NOTE:
           In the 1958 anes time-series study, V580007 and V580008 flags whether
           1958 respondents were previously interviewed in 1956.  However, some
           respondents flagged in these variables had been interviewed in 1956 not
           as part of the 1956 anes study's cross-section sample, but as part of a
           sample component intended for a separate 'panel' (non-cross-section)
           file.  Thus the actual count of cases from the 1958 study having 1956
           unique IDs in VCF0006a (as 1956xxxx, where xxxx is the 1956 ANES
           cross-section case ID) does not correspond with the count of cases
           flagged in V580007 and V580008 for previous participation in 1956.
           1960 NOTE:
           see 1958 NOTE; cases flagged in the 1960 ANES study for participation
           prior to 1960 may have participated outside of the time-series cross-
           section(s) in the year(s) of prior participation and may not correspond
           to the count of cases found here for initial time-series participation.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           See also VCF0012A, VCF0012B.  This describes paper questionnaires
           (1948-1994).
           1972 NOTE 1:
           57 Rs who were Pre Form I and 37 Rs who were Pre Form II were sent post
           mail questionnaires that contained most, but not all, of Form I/ Form
           II Post personal questions.  Rs who were Form I in the Pre but
           administered Post mail questionnaires were designated 'FORM III' in the
           Post, while Rs who were Form II in the Pre but who completed mail
           questionnaires for the Post were Post 'FORM  IV'.
           1972 NOTE 2:
           The same Form type was assigned in the Post as in the Pre.
           1986 NOTE:
           Form A questions were not asked of Form B respondents and vice versa,
           with two exceptions: both were asked VCF0830, with varied wording.
           1988 NOTE 1:
           Unlike other years, in 1988 all questions were present in both Form A
           and Form B, however some differed by form in wording or placement: e.g.
           VCF0517-VCF0518, VCF0830, VCF9076, VCF9084, VCF9092.
           1988 NOTE 2:
           same as 1972 NOTE 2.
           1994 NOTE:
           In 1994, the study included a 'ballot card' experiment.  Two ballot
           cards were drafted with identical content but different layout.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           This describes the presence of post-election data in ANES pre-post
           time-series studies: studies conducted in years of presidential
           elections and in 2002 were pre-post studies. In non-presidential years
           except 1954 and 2002, ANES has conducted a Post-election interview only,
           and all non-presidential years other than 1954 and 2002 have been coded

           1960 cases were any cases conducted with a Post-election interview
           but no Pre-election interview. In non-presidential years except 1954
           and 2002, ANES conducted a Post-election interview only, and all
           non-presidential years except 1954 and 2002 have been coded 0.*
           1954**, 2002 and presidential years other than 1948, 1952 and 1960 have

           1980 NOTE:
           Abbreviated Pre interviews were administered as replacements for
           discovered 'fake' interviews.
           1992 NOTE:
           In addition to 'long-form' or full personal mode questionnaires, short-
           form telephone questionnaires were prepared in both the Pre and Post
           waves for out-of-range panel cases.  Please see the full 1992 ANES
           documentation for a complete description. NOTE that, contrary to
           intentions, use of the short-form questionnaire was not limited to
           telephone mode, nor was long-form use confined to personal mode. [In
           a few cases the shorter interview was administered to 'fresh' cross-

           1996 NOTE:
           The Pre 'VQ file' or CAPI application was revised several times while
           in the field.  Beginning with the instrument with revision date 9/25/96,
           some questions (most of the items related to 1996 candidate Ross Perot)
           were dropped from the Pre.

           In the 1972 post, some respondents were sent mail questionnaires which

           respondents who were Form I in the Pre (see VCF0012) and who were

           were interviewed in the Post using the mail questionnaire were
           designated 'Form IV' in the Post

           GENERAL NOTE:
           Code-level Ns indicated are unweighted. The combined sample of panel and
           fresh-cross cases together constitute an overall representative cross-
           section for the time-series study.  Panel cases in 1958,1960,1974 and
           1976 are not flagged in the data of the respective time-series studies;
           for these years this variable has been coded from the 1956-1958-1960
           and 1972-1974-1976 merged panel files.
           1958 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 ( NOTE: the number
           of panel cases in the 1958 time-series data file does not correspond with
           the number of 1958 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960 merged panel file)
           1960 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 or 1958 ( NOTE: the
           number of panel cases in the 1950 time-series data file does not
           correspond with the number of 1950 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960
           merged panel file)
           1974 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 ( NOTE: the number
           of panel cases in the 1974 time-series data file does not correspond with
           the number of 1974 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976 merged panel file)
           1976 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 or 1974 ( NOTE: the
           number of panel cases in the 1975 time-series data file does not
           correspond with the number of 1976 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976

           1992 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1990.
           1994 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1992, as 1992 new fresh
           Cross-Section cases (no 1994 Panel cases had been interviewed in 1990).
           1996 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1994, and a portion had
           also been interviewed in 1992.
           2002 NOTE:
           Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 2000.

           NOTES:
           ------
           1992 NOTE:
           A shorter questionnaire was designed for telephone interviewing only,
           where telephone administration was intended for selected Panel cases;
           all long-form questionnaires were designed to be administered in
           person.  However, due to interviewer misunderstanding, 125 Pre
           interviews and 284 Post interviews -- including both Panel and new
           Cross-Section respondents --were administered over the telephone using
           long-form questionnaires.  Mode of interview here thus cannot be
           identified with short or long questionnaire (VCF0015a,VCF0015b).  [ NOTE:
           additionally, in 1 Pre case a Panel short-form interview was conducted
           in person.]
           1998 NOTE:
           This is the beginning mode of the interview; in some cases, the
           interview may have been suspended and completed in a different mode.
           2000 NOTE:
           Code 1 includes 5 cases which were personal in the Pre and intended to
           be switched to phone mode in the Post, but which were again
           administered face-to-face.

           For studies prior to 1978 it is not entirely certain whether any full
           or partial translations occurred, however none have been documented and
           all cases prior to 1978 are coded 0.  This was a question for the interviewer.
           1988 NOTE:
           A language variable appeared for the Pre but not the Post.
           1992 NOTE:
           In the Pre, a Spanish language version of the short questionnaire was
           administered to 22 cases; these 22 cases and 9 additional cases were
           coded in the language variable as including at least some translation.
           2004 NOTE:
           This was an admininstration (not interviewer) variable.
           Spanish language versions of the Pre and Post questionnaires were
           administered to Spanish-speaking respondents: these cases are coded 1.
           2008,2012 NOTE:
           This was an admininstration (not interviewer) variable, representing
           language at start of interview (English coded 0, Spanish coded 1).
           (Interviewer could switch between English or Spanish language at any
           point later in the interview.)

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           Prior to 1964 this appeared as a coded staff summary (not as a survey
           question).
           Except for 1968, in Pre-Post studies this variable is pre-election.
           Beginning in 1964, age variables in ANES Study datasets were created by
           computing R's age from his/her given date of birth (beginning in 1988,
           when birthdate was not available, age as given for household listing by
           R/informant was used instead).  The age calculation used in these
           Study datasets determined age at date of interview  in 1966, 1968,
           1970, 1972 and 1980-1994; it represented age on November 1 of the year
           of interview in 1976 and 1978.  In 1974, age on election day  of the
           year of interview was calculated.  For 1964, no documentation is extant
           describing exact calculation made.
           Prior to 1964, instead of age calculated using R's birthdate, age
           as given by R/informant (this information may have come from the
           coversheet) is represented.
           1948 NOTE:
           Age var was in the form of age groups and could not be included (see
           VCF0102).
           1954 NOTE:
           same as 1948.
           1960 NOTE:
           Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from these
           forms were incorporated into the (pre) age var listed.
           1992 NOTE:
           Birthdate was not asked in short-form interviews:  for panel 'short-
           form' cases, 2 years were added to the age that appeared in the 1990
           study; for short-form 'fresh' cross-section cases, age was pulled from

           2002 NOTE:
           For panel cases, 2 years were added to the age (if determined) that
           appeared in the 2000 study.
           2008 NOTE:
           Age was calculated from year of birth.
           2016 NOTE:
           Age was calculated from year of birth.

           same as 1980
           1992 NOTE:
           This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form
           panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
           1994 NOTE:
           For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
           2002 NOTE:
           For panel cases, 2000 data were incorporated.
           2004 NOTE:
           A question on Hispanic identity of household members was also
           administered as part of the screener (household listing).  Data for
           the screener identification of Hispanic status are found separately
           in the 2008 Time Series study data; screener Hispanic status was
           used in the construction of the 2008 study weights.
           2012 NOTE:
           Respondents are coded 1 or 2 if they gave one mention as Mexican/
           Mexican-American/Chicano or as Puerto Rican, or else if they gave
           multiple mentions but identified their closest group as one of those.
           2016 NOTE:
           Respondents are coded 1 or 2 if they gave one mention for country
           of origin as Mexico or Puerto Rico, or else if they gave more than
           one mention for country of origin but identified Mexico or Puerto
           Rico as the country from which 'most' of their family came. Respondents
           who gave more than one mention but who did not choose Mexico or
           Puerto Rico as the country from which most of their family came
           are coded 3. Respondents who identified themselves as Hispanic
           but who did not mention any country other than U.S.A. are coded 4.

      VCF0109            DEMOGRAPHICS: Respondent - Ethnicity

           In addition to being an American what do you consider your main
           ethnic group or nationality group?
           (IF MORE THAN 1 GROUP MENTIONED: ) With which of these groups do you
           most closely identify?

           MISSING CODES:

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           See ethnicicty codes- Appendix 'ETHNICITY'
           This represents the single mention of respondents who indicated only
           1 ethnic group and the 'most close' group (followup question) of
           respondents who indicated more than 1 ethnic group.
           There is no code to single out Rs who volunteered to assert their
           'American' identity.  This is because in most years these Rs were
           combined with NA and/or 'none' (no ethnic identity).
           1978 NOTE:
           A version of this question which included a (filter) lead-in was used:
           'In addition to being an American, is there another nationality group
           or ethnic group that you feel you belong to?   [IF YES]  What...'
           Because of this format, the 1978 distributions varied dramatically from
           other years, and 1978 data have not been included.
           1992 NOTE:
           This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form
           panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
           1994 NOTE:
           For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
           1996 NOTE:
           In a few cases R identified 2 or more nationality/ethnicity groups but
           the interviewer did not ask the 'choice' followup (due to incorrect
           completion of the IWR checkpoint); since R's chosen nationality/
           ethnicity remained undetermined, these cases (30) were considered
           missing data (code 99 here).

            tell me as best you can what you expect your (1966/1970) income to be--
            before taxes?  You may just tell me the letter of the group on this card

            letter of the income group that includes the income of all members of
            your family living here in [previous year] before taxes.  This figure
            should include salaries, wages, pensions, dividends, interest, and all

            your house in 1991.  First could you tell me if that was above or below
            $24,999? (IF UNCERTAIN: what would be your best guess?) (IF ABOVE/BELOW
            $24,999:) I will read you some income categories, could you please stop
            me when I reach the category that corresponds to your family situation?
            2000 TELEPHONE:

            category best describes the.total income of all members of your family
            living in your house in 1999 before taxes.  This figure should include
            salaries, wages, pensions, dividends, interest, and all other income.
            Please stop me when I get to your family's income.
            2012:

            please give your best guess?
            The next question is about [the total income of all the members of your
            family living here / your total income] in 2011, before taxes.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           See Appendix 'INCOME' for income ranges corresponding to these
           percentiles.
           Study coding of income was approximated as closely as possible to fit
           within this version.  Prior to 1972, this was an estimate of CURRENT
           year's income; since 1972, PREVIOUS year's income.  NOTE that in all
           years beginning 1976 this question was not actually asked if R was the
           only household member age 14 or over: in such cases, data from the
           question asking R's own income was duplicated. (Prior to 1976 R's
           own income was not determined.)
           Beginning in 1964, R was shown a respondent card or booklet.

           1960 NOTE:
           Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from
           these forms were incorporated.
           1996 NOTE:
           For 14 cases, interviewers entered responses where individual income
           was higher than family income.  In some of these cases, the responses
           for family income and R income may have been provided.entered in
           incorrect order.
           1998 NOTE:
           Some interviewers coded lowest income category when the respondent
           stated that he or she did not know what the household income was.
           Study staff has reviewed all interviewer comment material available to
           identify cases coded in the lowest category where comment NOTEs clearly
           indicate Don't Know; such cases have been recoded to DK.  However, it
           is not known whether there are additional DK cases (without recorded
           comments) for which lowest category had been incorrectly coded.
           2002 NOTE:
           Income categories were too broad for approximation here.
           2012 NOTE:
           Income range was included in the public release. Percentile group
           represents full (combined) 2012 sample, including both in-person
           (FTF) and Web respondents.
           2016 NOTE:
           Same as 2012.

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           See Appendix NOTE 'WORK STATUS'.
           See also VCF0116,VCF0150.
           No direct question asking R about his/her work status was used prior
           to 1968.  Instead, R was asked what his/her occupation was, and codes
           for 'student,' 'retired,' 'housewife,' 'unemployed' etc. appeared
           within the occupation codes from which this variable has been
           recoded. For years prior to 1972, this is respondent self-
           identification (exceptions described in the appendix for cases where R
           described self as working student or homemaker).
           For years 1972 and later except 2002 fresh cross, this is occupation
           status after the respondent has first self-identified in one or more
           occupation categories and then has answered other employment questions
           related to work history, number of  work hours etc.; for these years,
           it may be that coding here differs from R's initial self-
           identification(s).

           There's been some talk these days about different social classes.
           Most people say they belong either to the middle class or the working
           class.
           Do you ever think of yourself as belonging in one of these classes?
           Which one? /

           middle class or working class?
           (IF MIDDLE OR WORKING CLASS:) Would you say that you are about average
           middle/working class or that you are in the upper part of the middle/
           working class?

           as belonging to either middle or working class) were administered
           the followup that asked the respondent, if R 'had to make a choice,'
           to choose between middle or working.  In some years, respondents who
           refused or did not answer the initial question were also asked the choice
           question (2012,2008,2004,2000,1990 and 1 post Web respondent in 2016).
           In 2000 only, respondents who answered Yes to the initial question but
           who gave an Other response to the followup 'Which one?' were asked the
           choice question.
           Respondents who volunteered upper or lower class in response to any of
           the questions have been coded as such here (0 or 7).
           1992 NOTE:
           This set of questions was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire;
           for short-form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated
           in the 1992 summary var.

           the same as in VCF0148.
           2016 NOTE:
           In 2016, a half sample of respondents were asked this 4-question version for social class in the pre-election wave and the remaining half sample
           were asked in the post.

           Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican,
           a Democrat, an Independent, or what?  (IF REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT)
           Would you call yourself a strong (REP/DEM) or a not very strong
           (REP/DEM)?  (IF INDEPENDENT, OTHER [1966 AND LATER: OR NO PREFERENCE;
           2008: OR DK)
           Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic party?

           VALID CODES:
           ------------
           1. Strong Democrat
           2. Weak Democrat

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           This variable has been revised in accordance with the ANES memo on
           construction of the Party Identification Summary (available from the
           ANES Web site).
           For all years, this variable has been reconstructed in the following
           consistent manner:
           Code 1: initial mention Democrat; followup: strong.
           Code 2: initial mention Democrat; followup:  not strong.
           Code 3: initial preference independent,no preference, other, DK ;
                   followup: Democrat
           Code 4: initial preference independent,no preference, other, DK ;
                   followup: neither
           Code 5: initial preference independent,no preference, other, DK ;
                   followup: Republican
           Code 6: initial mention Republican; followup: not strong.
           Code 7: initial mention Republican; followup: strong
           2008 NOTE:
           The order of the parties in the initial question was randomized.

           you follow what's going on in government and public affairs most of the
           time, some of the time, only now and then, or hardly at all?
           1960, 1962:
           We'd also like to know how much attention you pay to what's going on in
           politics generally. I mean from day to day, when there isn't any big
           election campaign going on, would you say you follow politics very

      VCF0503            PARTIES: Democratic Party- Liberal-Conservative Scale

           We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
           I'm going to show you (1996 AND LATER: Here is) a seven-point scale

      VCF0508            PARTIES: Democratic Party- Government Health Insurance Scale

           There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and
           hospital costs.
           Some (1988,1994: people) feel there should be a government insurance
           plan which would cover all medical and hospital expenses (1988,1994:
           for everyone).
           Others feel that (1988,1994: all) medical expenses should be paid by
           individuals, and through private insurance like Blue Cross (1988,
           1994: or other company paid plans).
           Where would you place the Democratic Party on this scale  [1988 ONLY:
           or haven't you thought much about this]? (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           placements were not asked; however, if R responded DK or NA for self-
           placement party placements were asked.

      VCF0513            PARTIES: Democratic Party- Guaranteed Jobs-Living Scale

           Some people feel that the government in Washington should see to it
           that every person has a job and a good standard of living.  (1972-
           1978: Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point
           1).  Others think the government should just let each person get ahead
           on his/her own. (1972-1978: Suppose these people are at the other
           end, at point 7.  And, of course, some other people have opinions
           somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.)

              should become more powerful (1988,1992 ONLY); R's own opinion is that
              govt is not too strong AND should stay as it is (1988,1992 ONLY); R's

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           In 1964-1988,1992,2000, if the following answers were given when R was
           asked if R had an opinion on the question of whether the government is
           getting too powerful, then R was not asked this question:
           'no' (opinion) (1964,1976-1992,2000); 'no interest' (1968,1972); NA
           (all years); 'DK' (all years).
           Additionally, in 1964,1968,1972,1976,1988,1992,2000 if R replied 'yes,'
           that R did have an interest/opinion BUT responded 'DK' or NA when
           asked for that opinion, then R was not asked this question.
           In 1988,1992,2000, among Rs who indicated that they had an opinion on
           this issue, Respondents who were asked this question were limited to
           Rs having their own opinions as one of the following: 1) The government
           is too powerful; OR 2) The government is not getting too strong AND
           (followup) the government should become more powerful.
           1992 NOTE:
           46 cases were not asked this question due to an error in skip
           instructions.

      VCF0601            SYSTEM SUPPORT: Approve Participation in Protests

           There are many possible ways for people to show their disapproval or
           disagreement with governmental policies and actions.  I am going to
           describe three such ways.  We would like to know which ones you
           approve of as ways of showing dissatisfaction with the government and
           which ones you disapprove of.
           How about taking part in protest meetings or marches that are
           permitted by the local authorities?  Would you approve of taking part,
           disapprove, or would it depend on the circumstances?

           VALID CODES:

      VCF0604            SYSTEM SUPPORT: Trust the Federal Government To Do What is Right

           People have (1958,1964: I'd like to talk about some of the) different
           ideas about the government in Washington.  These ideas don't refer to
           Democrats or Republicans in particular, but just to government in
           general.  We want to see how you feel about these ideas.  (1996 and
           later: For example:)
           How much of the time do you think you can trust the government in
           Washington to do what is right -- just about always, most of the time
           (not 1966: or) only some of the time (1996: or almost never)?

           VALID CODES:
           ------------
           1. None of the time/never (VOLUNTEERED); almost never (1966 only)
           2. Some of the time

           2008 NOTE:
           This question was administered to a random half sample of respondents
           (verion 'OLD'); the remaining respondents were administered an
           alternative version of the question (version 'NEW').
           A half-sample of respondents were administered this question with
           response options in reverse order.
           2012 NOTE:
           This question was asked of a random 1/2 sample of respondents (the
           remaining 1/2 sample was asked a different version of the question).

      VCF0702            ELECTION: Did Respondent Vote in the National Elections

           1948:
           In the election, about half the people voted and about half of
           them didn't.  Did you vote?
           1962:
           One of the things we need to know is whether or not people really did
           get to vote this fall.  In talking to people about the election we find
           that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
           registered or they were sick or something else came up at the last
           minute.  Do you remember for sure whether or not you voted in the
           November election?
           1952-1960,1964-1998, 2002 VERSION 1, and 2004 VERSION 1:
           In talking to people about the election we (1972 AND LATER: often) find
           that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
           registered or they were sick or they just didn't have time. (1956-1960:
           How about you, did you vote this time?)  (1964-1970: How about you, did
           you vote this time, or did something keep you from voting) (1972-1976:
           How about you, did you vote in the elections this fall?) (1978 and
           later: How about you, did you vote in the elections this November?)
           2000, 2002 VERSION2, and 2004 VERSION 1: In talking to people about
           elections, we often find that a lot of people were not able to vote
           because they weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't
           have time.  Which of the following statements best describes you:
           One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
           Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
           Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or
           Four, I am sure I voted?

           1982 NOTE:
           For congressional districts GA04 and GA05, an additional question
           appeared:  How about the special US Congressional elections held
           November 30th.  Did you vote in that election?  From 1982, code 2
           includes all GA04, GA05 respondents who voted in either the November 2
           general election or the November 30 special election, or both.

           VCF0701/VCF0737 (VCF0701 pre-election data for 1952-1976,1980; VCF0737
           post-election data for 1978, 1982-later; for 1952 cases without pre-
           election interviews, post-election data from VCF0737).
           All respondents who reported voting have been coded 3, regardless of
           whether they actually reported being registered.
           No registration variable at all was present in 1958,1962,1966,1970 or
           1974.
           In some years a few respondents have declared that registration was not
           required in their state; these cases have been included with
           'registered'.
           2004 NOTE:
           This is a summary variable of vote and registration status.

           NOTES:
           ------
           See also VCF0735,VCF0736,VCF1011-VCF1013
           GENERAL NOTE:
           The Ballot Card was introduced in 1978.
           Note that VCF0707 and VCF0736 differ slightly from VCF1011-VCF1013 for
           years prior to 1978: see VCF1011.
           1952-1968:  When an 'incorrect' name--i.e., not on the list of
           candidates which the interviewer had for R's congressional district--
           was given with a party association, the party given was coded and is
           represented here.  When a 'correct' name was given with an incorrect
           party, however, the actual party associated with the named candidate
           was coded in Study data: 'Smith, a Democrat' was coded as a Republican
           if, in fact Smith was a Republican.  [In 1952-1968, party was asked for
           only if R did not know the candidate name or gave an 'incorrect' name.
           If R correctly named a candidate for his/her district without
           volunteering party association, party was not asked for, and factual
           party of candidate was coded.]  In 1958 ONLY, if the respondent gave

           the correct name of a candidate from another race in R's district, then
           R was informed of the named candidate's actual race and the question
           for R's House vote was repeated.
           In 1952, 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 this question was coded as a
           multiple response allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large
           mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
           response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF0707.
           1970-1976:  R's perception of candidate's party was coded.  If not
           volunteered, party of candidate was always asked for.  If party
           associated by R was not the actual party of a correctly named
           candidate, party as mentioned was still coded. Even if an 'incorrect'
           name (i.e., name not on the interviewer's list of candidate names--see
           VCF1006 for description of lists) was given, party associated by R was
           coded.
           Ballot card 1978-1982, 1984 personal, 1986 and later: when R gave a
           name not on the ballot card, the party of actual vote remained
           undeterminable (0 in VCF0707), unless R voted outside district of
           interview and R's major party vote from 'outside' district could be
           established (if a recognizable name was given).
           No ballot card 1980-later:  Respondents who had voted outside the
           Congressional District of their sample selection location could not use
           the Ballot Card, and question wording was altered somewhat. 1980 was
           the first year that cases of 'outside' Congressional District voting
           were identified.
           1984 NOTE:
           In Post telephone interviews, If the interviewer had the correct Ballot
           Card at hand, then he or she attempted to read the names and party
           affiliations of the House candidates [see question wording above].
           1992 NOTE:
           In telephone interviews, names were not read by the interviewer, but
           attempt was made, in many cases, to leave ballot cards with respondents
           if a telephone appointment was made.
           1994 NOTE:
           A 'ballot card' experiment was conducted; see VCF0012.
           1996 NOTE:
           same as 1992
           2000 NOTE:
           For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of
           candidate names was randomized on the Ballot Card/as read by
           interviewers.
           2002 NOTE:
           For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of
           candidate names was randomized as read by interviewers.

           NOTES:
           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           This is a pre var.
           For 1952-1976, codes 1 and 3 also include presidential candidate vote
           intentions 'with qualifications.'   Codes for candidate vote intention
           'with qualifications' did not appear after 1976.
           In 1952-1976, if R's response to the question 'As far as you know, do
           you expect to vote in the elections this November?' was 'yes,
           qualified' (think so/ guess so/ probably, etc.), R was asked this
           question; if R's response was 'no, qualified' (probably not,  etc.)
           R has been included in code 4; if R's response was 'pro-con,' then
           this has been coded 0.

           or 'pro-con'.

           Howabout the elections for other state and local offices, did you
           vote a straight ticket or did you vote for candidates from different
           parties.  (IF STRAIGHT TICKET: )  Which party?/ (IF SPLIT TICKET:)  How

           1962 NOTE:
           'Split ticket, mostly 'other' party' was combined in study data with
           'split ticket, NA how split.'  Because of the very small number of
           cases voting mostly or entirely for a 3rd/minor party, this combination
           category was recoded to 3.
           1958 NOTE:
           If R voted Democratic or Republican with only 1 exception, then R
           was coded as 'straight ticket.'

           1952,1956,1960,1964,1968,1972,1976:
           We're (1952: mainly) interested in this interview in finding out whether
           people paid much attention to the election campaign this year.  Take
           newspapers for instance--did you read (1972 ONLY: much) about the
           campaign in any newspaper?
           1974:
           (IF R READS A DAILY NEWSPAPER:) Did you read anything about the campaign
           this year in any newspaper?
           1978-1986,1990:
           Did you read about the campaign in any newspapers?
           1988,1992 AND LATER:
           (IF R HAS READ A DAILY NEWSPAPER IN THE PAST WEEK:) Did you read about
           the campaign in any newspaper?

           VALID CODES:
           ------------
           1. No, read no newspapers about the campaign
           2. Yes, read newspaper(s) about the campaign

           See VCF0724.
           GENERAL NOTE:
           In 1974, 1988 and 1992, this question was preceded by a filter. The
           1974 filter was:  Do you read a daily newspaper?  In 1988 and 1992 the
           filter was:  How many days in the past week did you read a daily
           paper?  Rs who replied 'no' [1974] or 'none' [1988] to the filter
           question were not asked this question.  However, 1974 Rs who replied
           'no' have been coded 1 while 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied 'none' have
           been coded 0.
           In most years, this question was accompanied by a follow-up question
           which asked how much/how often R read campaign articles, how many
           campaign articles R read, or how much attention R paid to campaign
           articles. If the respondent had read articles at all, regardless how
           little, then R has been coded 2.  Several 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1996
           respondents who replied 'yes' to the main question, but who replied in
           the followup question that they paid 'no attention' to articles, have

      American National Election Study 1948-2016 - Cumulative         Page 361


           still been coded 2.  From the 1980 and 1984 studies, however, several
           respondents who answered 'yes' to the main question but who then
           volunteered in the followup that they read 'no' articles have been
           coded 1 rather than 2.  The 1974 and 1978 follow-up questions have
           been disregarded.
           1972 NOTE:
           Addition of 'much' to wording affected distributions significantly.
           2008 NOTE:
           This question was administered to a random half sample of respondents
           using verion 'OLD'; the remaining respondents were administered an
           alternative version (version 'NEW') which was specific to the
           Presidential campaign only.
           2012 NOTE:
           Wording in 2012 was not comparable ('campaign for President')

           coded with valid data during a year when all 4 questions are used by
           NES, then this value is computed.

           but when asked how many days in past week replied 'never'; it also
           includes cases where R answered 'no' to lead-in.
           Respondents with NA response for how often R discusses politics with
           family and friends (VCF0732) were INAP for this question.
           Beginning 1992, respondents with DK response for how often R discusses
           politics with family and friends (VCF0732) were also INAP for this
           question.
           1984 NOTE:
           If R replied 'every day' for how often R discusses politics with family
           and friends (VCF0732) then this question was not asked; for such
           respondents 7 (every day) has been coded here.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           1980 was the first year that 'outside' Congressional District voting
           was identified.
           Codes 81-92 first appeared in 1980 study data (not in 1978 data).
           1992 and later:  Code 97 includes cases where R volunteered that
           he/she voted 'a straight ticket' but no candidate for R's party ran;
           it also includes cases where R insists that he/she voted for a
           specific party's candidate but no candidate from that party ran in R's
           district.  For Rs who voted outside district of interview location,
           code 97 also includes candidates named by R but whose CD and party are
           not known.  It also includes cases where R names a candidate but the
           name is not among names of candidates within a known 'outside' CD.
           2012 NOTE:
           Candidate codes were not assigned 2012 and later.

           in both the Pre and Post. Summary registration status for these years
           can be found in VCF0703.

           For voter or registered nonvoter who stated that registration did not
           require declaration of party in R's area or if R was a (reported) voter
           who stated that voters were not required to register: 6 has been coded.
           Nonvoter Rs who replied that voters were not required to register in
           their area have been coded 9.  Nonvoter Rs who replied 'DK' or NA when
           asked if they were registered have also been coded 9. Nonvoter Rs who
           replied that they were registered but, when asked for party of
           registration, replied that voters were not required to register in
           their areas have been coded 9.
           If R was a non-voter who first declared registration status but, when
           asked for party registered, replied that R was not registered, 0 has
           been coded.
           Beginning in 2012, respondents were asked party of registration in both
           the Pre and Post. A future release of the CDF will provide a summary
           variable for party of registration that is not wave specific.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           In 1952,1956,1960,1964 no category appeared (coded) for 'no preference.'
           Although a category appeared for 'no preference' in 1968, R was not
           asked the filter question, 'Did you prefer one of the candidates for
           president?' and the absence of this filter was reflected in the small
           1968 'no preference' N (presumably volunteered responses). In 1980,
           1984, 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied 'no' to the filter question were
           coded 7 here.

           (ASKED OF Rs WHO VOTED):
           How about the vote/election for Governor (1952, 1958: here in [state])?
           Did you vote for a candidate for Governor?  (IF YES:) Who did you vote
           for?  Which party was that?

           INAP. question not used

           NOTES:
           ------
           See Appendix NOTE 'STATES AND PARTIES OF ELECTIONS/CANDIDATES'.
           GENERAL NOTE:
           Ballot card was not used until 1978.  In 1978-1982, 1986 R selected
           name from ballot card.  When R gave a name not on the candidate list,
           MD was coded, and party of vote was undetermined.
           In 1952, 1958, 1964-1968 (no ballot card), when an incorrect name--
           i.e., not on the candidate list--was given with a party association,
           the party given was coded.  When a correct name was given with an
           incorrect party, then the actual party associated with the named
           candidate was coded: 'Smith, a Democrat' was coded as a Republican if,
           in fact  (contrary to R's perception) Smith was indeed a Republican.
           In 1970-1976 (no ballot card), R's perception of candidate's party was
           given.  If an incorrect name (not on the candidate list) was given,
           party associated was still coded.  If a given party was not the actual
           party of a correctly named candidate, party as given was still coded.
           In 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1964, this question was coded as a multiple
           response variable allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large
           mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
           response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF9025.
           If R did not vote AND R's state did not have a gubernatorial race,
           then 0 (not 9) has been coded.
           In 1980, 1982, 1986, 1990:  if there was no race in state of IW BUT it
           was determined that R voted outside of state of IW AND R designated
           his/her vote for governor in the other state, then this variable has

      American National Election Study 1948-2016 - Cumulative         Page 409


           been coded for the party of R's 'outside' vote, not coded 0 MD (no
           race in state).  Before 1980, it was not determined whether R voted
           outside of state of IW, and no information was previously available
           for any votes for governor outside of state of IW.
           2016 NOTE:
           In 2016, state of vote was determined for voters who voted outside
           state of residence; this variable represents vote in state of vote.

           1972:
            (ASKED OF Rs WHO SAID THEY WERE REGISTERED/ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN
            NOVEMBER): How about the primary election this year.  Did you vote in
            a presidential primary this spring or summer? (IF YES:)  Which party's
            primary did you vote in?
            1976:
            (ASKED OF Rs WHO SAID THEY WERE REGISTERED/ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN
            NOVEMBER):  How about the primary election this year?  Do you happen

            this spring or summer?  (IF YES:)  Did you vote in the presidential
            primary election?  (IF YES:) Which party's primary did you vote in?
            1980:

            SOUTH CAROLINA, MISSISSIPPI)
            1988:
            This state held a presidential primary/caucus election in [month].  In
            talking to people about elections, we find that a lot of people were not
            able to vote because they weren't registered, they didn't meet party
            qualifications, they were sick or just didn't have the time.  How about
            you--did you vote in that primary election/ caucus?  (IF YES:) Did you
            vote in the Republican or the Democratic primary/caucus?
            1992:
            This state held a Presidential (primary/caucus) election in [month].  In
            talking to people about elections, we find that many people did not vote
            for a variety of reasons.  How about you--did you vote in that primary
            (election/caucus)?  (IF YES:) Did you vote in the Republican or
            Democratic (primary/caucus)?

           GENERAL NOTE:
           See Appendix NOTE 'STATES AND PARTIES OF ELECTIONS/CANDIDATES'.
           1972 NOTE 1:
           'Caucus' was not specified.
           1972 NOTE 2:
           This question was only asked of Rs who said they were registered
           (eligible) to vote; if NA whether registered/ eligible or R didn't know
           if R was registered/eligible, then R was not asked this question.
           Additionally, in 1976, R was first asked the question whether R
           recalled if R's state had a primary during the spring/summer of the
           study year:  if R did recall whether there was a primary AND if R's
           state did indeed have a primary, then this question was asked.
           1976 NOTE 1:
           same as 1972 NOTE 1.
           1976 NOTE:
           same as 1972 NOTE 2.
           1980 NOTE 1:
           same as 1972.
           1980 NOTE 2:
           votes in nonmajor party primaries were not accounted for (no code 5).
           1980 NOTE 3:
           Several states had only one primary for one major party.  In 1980
           Arkansas held a Democratic primary; South Carolina held a Republican
           primary; and Mississippi held a Republican primary.  If R indicated
           that R voted in the party's primary that year, then R was coded here
           for the party of the primary held.  The question asked in Arkansas,
           South and Carolina and Mississippi in 1980 was: Your state held a
           primary election on [date].  As you may know, the [Democratic/
           Republican] party did not have a primary contest in [state] this year,
           so there was only a [Democratic/Republican] primary election. Did you
           vote in that election or were you unable  to do so?
           1988 NOTE 1:
           All states represented in the time series study had a primary or
           caucus.  However, in some states (Kansas, Michigan and Wyoming
           Democratic and Republican caucuses were held on separate dates and the
           lead-in question was modified accordingly.
           1988 NOTE 2:

           GENERAL NOTE:
           This question refers to the Presidential election preceding the current
           year.
           In 1952-1960,1964-1972,1976,1980, if R answered the filter, 'In the
           elections for president since you have been old enough to vote, would
           you say that you have voted in all of them, most of them, some of them,
           or none of them?' with 'none of them' or answered that s/he was never
           before able to vote because s/he was previously not a citizen or old
           enough, then this question was not asked.
           In 1956, 1960, 1976 and 1980, if it was NA whether R had ever voted,
           then this question was not asked.  In 1968, if R DK whether R had ever
           voted, then this question was not asked.
           In 1962, 1982, 1988, 1990 and 1992 no filter was used, but Rs who did
           not vote in the previous presidential election because of age or
           citizenship ineligibility (or for any other reason) were simply coded
           'did not vote'.
           In 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 the study  documentation stated that
           residents of Washington D.C. were INAP; however, in the data, it
           some Washington D.C. residents were INAP while others were not.
           1952 NOTE 1:
           Code 9 contains 9 cases of respondents who replied that they 'thought'
           they had voted Democratic in 1948 and 3 cases of respondents who
           replied that they 'thought' they had voted Republican in 1948.
           1952 NOTE 2:
           In the original 1952 dataset, 1948 presidential votes for two
           specified nonmajor party candidates were individually coded, and there
           also appeared a combination category labeled 'other or NA or DK who'
           (9 cases).  Rs who said they had voted for the specified nonmajor
           party candidates in 1948 have been coded 5 here, while Rs from the
           combination category of the original 1952 dataset have been coded 3

           particular candidate in 1952 were combined with other missing data:
           these cases are coded 9 here.

           GENERAL NOTE:
           Weight variable VCF0010/VCF0010A must be used if
           distributions including 1970 data are desired:  see VCF0010.
           Note that use of VCF0010/VCF0010A as a weight reduces the
           1970 total N for this variable:  form 2 whites who should appear as
           code 0 INAP cases are excluded from the 1970 total N.
           1992 NOTE:
           This question was asked in both the pre and post; the pre data have
           been incorporated here.

      VCF9037            ISSUES: Government Should Ensure Fair Jobs for Blacks

           Some people feel that if black people (1964,1968: negroes) are not
           getting fair treatment in jobs, the government in Washington ought
           to see to it that they do.  Others feel that this is not the federal
           government's business.
           Have you had enough interested in this question to favor one side over
           the other?
           1964,1968,1972:
           (IF YES) How do you feel? Should the government in Washington see to
           it that black people get fair treatment in jobs or should the
           government in Washington leave these matters to the states and local
           communities?
           1986 AND LATER:
           (IF YES) How do you feel? Should the government in Washington see to
           it that black people get fair treatment in jobs or is this not the

           2004: Now I'm going to read several more statements.  After each

           ALL YEARS:
           'Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice
           and worked their way up.  Blacks should to the same without any
           special favors.'
